# HackReality2021
During this Hackathon, we built a virtual system for helping the healthcare industry. In this system, they can be trained in various activities as well as educated in an interactive style. This project serves as a proof of concept of what can be done in the near future. Currently, the system educates on how vaccines are developed as well as allows healthcare workers such as doctors and nurses to interact with virtual patients and practice without risk.

Note: Several Assets not in github due to upload limitations. See here for full src.

## Technologies Used
This project was developed using the Unity Game Engine using the Oculus Integration libraries. All code is written in C#.

## Inspiration
Recently due to the COVID-19 virus, learning has become increasingly difficult, especially for people that require direct physical access to equipment. New healthcare workers such as new nurses and doctors also cannot get the same real experience working with patients anymore. This project was aimed to help solve these issues.

## Challenges we ran into
VR Development in Unity is a new topic for us, so we started this project unfamiliar with many things. We had to spend time learning and experimenting with Unity and the Oculus. We also had a significant time issue, since we had classes/exams as well as various other obligations throughout the week. Since we are Computer Science students, we were not aware of the various biology and chemistry / general healthcare information that was needed for this project, so we had to spend special time doing research in those areas to learn.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that we were able to overcome the challenges we faced and produce a completed project that could be useful in the real world in the near future. We are also proud of all that we learned over the course of this project and Hackathon.

## What we learned
We learned a lot of XR systems, more specifically VR systems. We also learned more about Unity and how to develop VR applications through it. As part of the development of this project, we had to research various biology/chemistry topics and information about the existing COVID-19 vaccines, it provided us with a lot of new knowledge that we had previously not had.

## What's next for this Virtual Healthcare System
This project is just a prototype of what can be done. This technology can span beyond just vaccines and into other fields of healthcare, such as surgery or telemedicine. The virtual interaction with patients is also limited in this project and can be easily expanded upon in the future.

## Running the Application
Download the latest release and install it onto your mobile device or VR headset.
