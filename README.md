# HackReality2021
During this Hackathon, we built a virtual system for helping the healthcare industry. In this system, they can be trained in various activities as well as educated in an interactive style. This project serves as a proof of concept of what can be done in the near future. Currently, the system educates on how vaccines are developed as well as allows healthcare workers such as doctors and nurses to interact with virtual patients and practice without risk.

Note: Several Assets not in github due to upload limitations. See here for full src.
